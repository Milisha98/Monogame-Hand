## Game Overview

## Boss Phases

### Phase 1: Chaos Keys

- Random keys on the boss light up and fire bullet patterns.

- The player must dodge incoming fire while navigating the screen.



---

### Phase 2: Spell ‚ÄúUNLOCK‚Äù

- One letter from the word **UNLOCK** glows at a time.

- Only one key is active at a time to simplify targeting.

- Shooting the correct key progresses the sequence.

- Optional: Incorrect shots can be ignored or trigger retaliation.

### Final Phase: Escape & Enter

- After spelling ‚ÄúSHUTDOWN‚Äù, the boss begins to flee upward.

- It drops mines in a zigzag pattern.

- A large glowing **Enter** key appears at the top of the screen.

- The player must dodge mines and shoot the **Enter** key to finish the boss.

- Successful hit triggers a retro-style explosion and a message: `ACCESS GRANTED`.

## Design Notes

- Keep visuals simple and readable in 8-bit style.

- The ‚ÄúEnter‚Äù key should feel like a final, rewarding moment.

## Development Tips

- Consider using a state machine to manage boss phases.

- Keep bullet patterns readable but challenging.
